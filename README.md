First calculator project for Entry test. JR


# Calculator

It was requested to make a calculator with react.js and with hook .
Simple calculator that performs simple arithmetic calculations

## Start üöÄ

To do the ReactJS installation:
Step 1. Install NodeJS in its latest version, for that we will enter its official website and download the most updated installer https://nodejs.org/es/

Step 2. Update NPM, the node package manager, to download the most current dependencies:
``` 
   npm install -g npm @ latest
```
Step 3. Install the "Create React" app:
```
  npm install -g create-react-app
```
Now we have installed "Create React" app and we can generate a new React.js project
To generate a new React.js project and finally install it, we will enter the directory where we want to generate the reactjs project and execute this command:
```
   create-react-app MyProjectName
```

### Installation üîß

Clone the repository in the created folder "MyProjectName"

Then we will enter our project directory and launch the local test server for React:
```
  cd MyProjectName
  npm start
```
You can check the version of React you have inside the package.json file.
Now we will have the React 16 webapp available at http: // localhost: 3000 / and we will see our project running, with the welcome page by default.
